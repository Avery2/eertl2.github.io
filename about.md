I'm currently a Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I enjoy coding, running, biking, EDM, chess, anime, and playing video games. Right now I'm trying to improve my HTML & CSS skills by helping code the FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) Club's <a href="https://foss-uw.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> here at UW-Madison. 

Last summer I interned at <a href="https://www.mgsmfg.com/" target="_blank">MGS Mfg.</a> as an IT intern, where I digitized their auditing process to increase accountability, faster data analysis, and increased accountability from workers.
