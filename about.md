I'm currently a Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I enjoy coding, running, biking, EDM, chess, anime, and playing video games. Right now I'm trying to improve my HTML & CSS skills by helping code the FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) Club's [website](https://fossclub-uw.org/) here at UW-Madison. 

Last summer I interned at [MGS Mfg.](https://www.mgsmfg.com/) as an IT intern, where I digitized their auditing process which led to faster audits, enhanced data analytics, and increased accountability from workers.
